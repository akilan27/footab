# FooTab

The reason this didn't work: https://github.com/akilan27/footab/issues/1

There is a successfully working extension which offers same functionality here: https://github.com/hrj/sloth

===============

Originaly from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/footab/

This was made avaiable in Chrome web store by Jason here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/footab/anbodogikfbehidmmjdokehphginagbb

This recently stopped working, so I cloned it here and I'm hoping to fix the issue.
